My research centers around nonlinear wave phenomena. I am especially interested in mathematical aspects of nonlinear acoustics and the use of mathematical tools in the development of different ultrasonic applications. Particular topics include:

<ul>
<li> Well-posedness and regularity of nonlinear acoustic wave models  </li>
<li> Error analysis of finite-element discretizations </li>
<li> Absorbing boundary conditions for open-domain problems </li>
<li> Optimization of ultrasonic focusing devices </li>
</ul>
